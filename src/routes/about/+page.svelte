		<p>
			After graduating High School in 2017, I wanted to go to college and achieve a bachelor's
			degree. At the time, I had no clue what degree or career I wanted to pursue. So, I needed to
			explore the options and degrees that sparked my interest. Eventually finding myself in the Web
			Design and App Development program at Utah Valley University (UVU), I found my passion for
			bringing ideas to life. At the end of 2023, I'll be graduating with my bachelor's degree.
		</p>

		<p>
			My specialization is application development and my primary programming language is
			JavaScript. Everything about this field is exciting to me, and I will always be working to
			improve my skills and knowledge to be a master at my craft. Having experience in multiple
			modern frameworks and libraries, allows me to adapt to a project's needs and goals. Pairing
			that with my skills in UX design enables me to bring rich applications to life with purpose
			that are accessible to everyone.

		<!-- <p>
			Collaboration with others is an oppurtunity I yearn for. Working on projects with a team
			always enables me to learn from others and improve myself, as well have a great time with
			others. My time at UVU, I've been fortunate enough to get to work on projects with my peers
			and that taught me how to communicate with others. Then, my senior year I've been leading two
			projects with 3-4 on each team. Which has taught me important skills in leading a team,
			ensuring the project is successful. These two projects have really left an impact on me and
			are why I strive to work with others to bring ideas to life.
