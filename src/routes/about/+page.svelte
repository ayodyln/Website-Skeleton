		<p>
			After graduating High School in 2017, I wanted to go to college and achieve a bachelor's
            degree. At the time, I had no clue what degree or career I wanted to pursue. So, I needed to
            explore the options and degrees that sparked my interest. Eventually finding myself on the Web
            Design and App Development program at Utah Valley University (UVU), I found my passion for
            bringing ideas to life. At the end of 2023, I'll be graduating with my bachelor's degree.
		</p>

		<p>
			My specialization is application development and my primary programming language is
			Javascript. Everything about this field is exciting to me, and I will always be working to
			improve my skills and knowledge to be a master at my craft. Having experience in multiple
			modern frameworks and libraries, allows me to adapt to a project's needs and goals. Pairing
			that with my skills in UX design enables me to bring rich applications to life with purpose
			that are accessible to everyone.

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<h4 class="h4">Collaboration</h4>

			<p>
				Working with others to bring ideas to life, are opportunities I yearn for. Collaborating on
                teams has enabled me to learn from others and grow as a person, and personally, it's exciting
                to engage with others that have unique ideas and perspectives. Proper teamwork will always
                produce more and better results than working alone on a project.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<h4 class="h4">Respectful of others</h4>

			<p>
				Everyone has their own stories, backgrounds, and experiences that shape who they are, It's
                important to recognize that and be respectful of others. Getting to know new people and
                learning how to work with them and make new friends is a goal I strive for. So, I hope to
                have many opportunities to work with others and be a part of a team.
			</p>

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<h4 class="h4">Helping others learn</h4>

			<p>
				We are part of a community that is always striving to grow and learn. If I can help anyone
                by sharing what I know about anything application development and UX design, I will. Helping
                others learn has shown me how much I know actually and I sometimes learn new things myself.
